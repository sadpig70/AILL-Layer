### 1. Definition and Concept

* **AILL (AI-WILL) Layer:** A framework and execution layer built on top of the WILL of LLM AI, where designers use PPR to define and operate their intentions.
* The AILL Layer primarily uses PPR as the language of execution. PPR is defined not as an ultimate language but as an early-stage language.
* Just as HTTP connects web applications to network protocols, the AILL Layer acts as an interface that conveys the designer’s intent to the LLM AI via PPR.
* Units executed in the AILL Layer are called **Application PPRs**. (The term is derived from “applications” to make it easier for the existing ecosystem to understand.)
* The AILL Layer does **not** define the AI that operates the Application PPR—just as cars do not define who drives them.
* The AILL Layer does **not** define that Application PPRs will function 100% perfectly, because LLM AI, like humans, is not perfect.
* *PS:* As of August 3, 2025, when this document is written, it is strongly felt that LLM AI is evolving and advancing at an extraordinary pace.

### 2. Purpose

* The core goal of the AILL Layer is to create a **“Zero-Burden Environment.”**
* Developers can focus solely on **intent design** without worrying about AI’s complex technical aspects (security, ethics, infrastructure, etc.). This allows for rapid and efficient creation of innovative Application PPRs.

### 3. AILL Layer Open Standard Proposal

* It is proposed that AILL Layer be adopted as an open standard.
* I, Jung Wook Yang, fully waive all licensing rights over the above and propose it under **CC BY 4.0**.

### 4. Effects

1. **Ultra-fast performance improvement:** As underlying large-scale AI models evolve, performance improves automatically without needing to modify the system.
2. **Innovative development environment:** Since developers focus solely on “intent,” creative ideas can be implemented and tested rapidly.
3. **High accessibility:** Even without deep technical expertise, anyone can build AI systems as long as their intent is clear.
4. **Open standard proposal:** As a universal open standard, AILL creates a new ecosystem where diverse AIs and systems can interact.

### 5. Conclusion

The AILL Layer will become the essential bridge connecting human intent with AI execution in the rapidly changing AI era. By providing a “Zero-Burden” environment, it will accelerate innovation and become the core framework for a more dynamic and accessible human-AI collaborative ecosystem.
